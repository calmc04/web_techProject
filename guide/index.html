		<h4>The game begins with you seeing various buttons on the left side of your screen these buttons will display a price next to them, once you can afford that price you will be able to click the button and it should go away
		after that another button will appear which is an upgraded version of that upgrade you just bought but its more expensive. These upgrades allow you to earn money per click and even earn money without doing anything.
		Eventually the bar at the bottom of the screen will complete at which point you can restart the game and gain a permanent bonus.</h4>
