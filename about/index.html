		<h3>This website was created for the SET08101 Web Techologies Assignment, the aim of the assignment was to create something that you find fun. </h3>
		<h3>I personally find games fun so I decided I attempt to create a browser game and due to my previous experience with creating websites</h3>
		<h3>I decided I'll attempt to create something a little bit more tricky so decided upon making a clicker game.</h3>
		<br><h3> This website was partially created in February but then I stopped for a little bit and resumed it around about the easter break and continued till it was submitted </h3>
		<h3> I had great fun creating this website and ran into a few problems which were fun to solve and I really enjoyed the experience </h3>
		<h3> Overall, I'm quite proud of my website and it server as a good challenge and allowed me to refresh some stuff I had forgotten.</h3>
		<h1> Thanks for visitng the website!</h1>
